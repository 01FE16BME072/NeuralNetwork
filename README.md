# NeuralNetwork
As a part of my learning on NeuralNetwork i coded NeuralNetwork 
Mainly there are 2 files one file consisting of neural network from scratch named as pynetk3.py you can use this to do build the neural network for your data but make sure to replace the last few lines of code with your line of code.
And ann.py is the implementation of the neural network using the Keras model working on a bank dataset
