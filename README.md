# NeuralNetwork
As a part of my learning on NeuralNetwork i coded NeuralNetwork 
Mainly there are 2 files one file consisting of neural network from scratch named as pynetk3.py you can use this to do build the neural network for your data but make sure to replace the last few lines of code with your line of code
Next on the second file i implemented a neural network using keras library which uses tensorflow at its backened as a part of learning keras library and also with a bank dataset for implementation
